## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS and JS library


### Continued development

I want to explore and continue develop with Bootstrap. This' my first project ussing Boostrap, and I had some issues creating an accordion by myself in vanilla JS, so I prefer to used this library. The final result it's not perfect, but It's look very nice for me.

## Acknowledgments

Review your class names for styling the project if you use Bootstrap. I have some issues when I added the library for the first time and I lose my styles. It's not a big deal but maybe it's useful for a beginner like me.
